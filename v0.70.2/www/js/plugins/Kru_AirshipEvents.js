 * Information
 * ==================================================================
 *
 * By default, RPG Maker MV doesn't allow Airships to interact with 
 * events â€“ this plugin removes that limitation.  
 *
 * Note that you'll have to create special handling for dealing with
 * transfers (e.g. entering towns, etc.) for airships to use this as
 * expected.  The easiest way to achieve this is to add to your event
 * a Conditional Branch for Vehicle: Airship is driven and move the
 * transfer into the Else clause.
 *
 * Terms & Conditions
 * This plugin is free for both non-commercial and commercial use.
